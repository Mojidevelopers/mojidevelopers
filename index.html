<p> A well-designed website ensures that the visitor can quickly find the information he or she is looking for. The information must be designed in such a way that it is emotionally attractive, physically functional, and visually appealing. Aside from being able to please visitors, the website design should also appeal to search engines, allowing it to rank at the top of search results. It's quite tough to please both humans and search engines because their needs are so dissimilar. The key is to be able to include these needs into a website design that is acceptable by both people and search engines.
